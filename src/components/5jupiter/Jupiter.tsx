        System. It is a gas giant with a mass two and a half times that of all the other 
        planets in the Solar System combined, but less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun."
        internalStructure="When the Juno arrived in 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very 
        diffuse core that mixes into its mantle. A possible cause is an impact from a planet 
        of about ten Earth masses a few million years afte
        r Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core."
        surfaceGeology="The best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic 
        storm located 22Â° south of the equator. It is known to have existed since at least 1831, and possibly 
        since 1665."
